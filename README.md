# Toy package: regexcite

Sample package from the 2nd edition of “R Packages” by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan (https://r-pkgs.org/)

We call the package regexcite and it contains a couple of functions that make common tasks with regular expressions easier. Please note that these functions are very simple and we’re only using them here as a means to guide you through the package development process.
